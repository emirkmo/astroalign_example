See the notebook for the example. The data is also present as pickled numpy arrays (failing that, you can copy paste from the notebook; they are not large arrays).

Since posting, I also ensured that any parallax and proper motion effects are taken into account, (even though the observations were only 3 years from the reference epoch.) Just to make sure the asterisms were not distrupted by high proper motion reference stars.
